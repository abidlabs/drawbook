    "#     \"Mustafa and Musa hurried back home to show their babas the seeds. Their babas told them that all plants need three things: sunlight, water, and soil.\",\n",
    "#     \"So the boys planted their seeds in a big pot with fertile soil. They put the pot outside so it could get bright sunlight, and they watered their plant every day.\",\n",

    "#     \"The next day, Mustafa and Musa went to visit the farm. All their friends were there, and they all had tall, beautiful sunflowers in large pots.\",\n",
    "#     \"Mustafa and Musa gulped nervously when the farmer came to them. He asked, 'Where is your sunflower?'\",\n",
    "#     \"The boys told the farmer sadly, 'We tried our best to grow our sunflower, we gave it water, sunlight, and soil, but it didn't grow at all no matter what we did. That's the truth.'\",\n",
    "#     \"The farmer smiled, and announced loudly, 'I will give my farm to Mustafa and Musa!'\",\n",
    "#     \"The boys were shocked. 'Why? Our plant didn't even grow, sir.' The farmer responded softly, 'None of the plants grew. I gave you all boiled seeds, which means that they would never grow into sunflowers at all.'\",\n",
    "#     \"'All these other boys who have sunflowers, they must have gotten them from the store. Since you two boys told the truth, you will get the farm, the chickens, the goats, the roses, and yes -- even the sunflowers.'\",\n",
    "#     \"Mustafa and Musa were so happy, they said 'Alhamdulillah, we will always tell the truth' and they ran home to their babas to tell them the good news.\",\n",
